Project Background
 ClimateWins wants you to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in
 mainland Europe. It’s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the
past 10 to 20 years. However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and
 planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it
 hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.
 Here are the questions it wants to answer first:
 ● Howismachine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
 ● ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are
 there any concerns specific to this project?
 ● Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
 ● Canmachine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on
 a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)
 Context
 Python is one of the most-used programming languages when it comes to working with machine
 learning. There are also many different types of machine learning available, each of which is
 suitable for different subjects and classifications. One of the largest divisions exists between
 supervised and unsupervised learning models. Both can be used to predict new data—just in
 different ways. Throughout this Achievement, you’ll learn the building blocks of optimization and
 machine learning so that you can assess which types of models would be most helpful for
 predicting weather data. By the time you finish, you should be able to prepare data for machine
 learning analysis, perform the analysis with both simple and complex algorithms, and derive
 information from the models’ results
